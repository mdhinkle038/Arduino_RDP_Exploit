# Arduino_RDP_Exploit
This will create a new admin user to a computer running windows 10,
computer must be an admin user to begin with and only works on LAN, 
so works best on personal window 10 computers, 
it pings your computer so use a VM running wireshark to capture the icmp protocol packets to obtain their IP, 
open up RDP window and connect to their computer, 
eventually will publish an updated code that runs on windows 7 and 8.
please provide feedback so i may strengthen this arduino program
